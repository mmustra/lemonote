===============

"When aviation gives you lemons, note it!"
This tool helps you copy/paste notes in any application and generate GDS commands
through user-friendly dialogs.

https://github.com/mmustra/lemonote


USAGE
=====

Once Lemonote is running it will show in your tray (yellow lemon icon).
By right-clicking on it you will get a list of options to choose from:

- Reload Lemonote; reloads application and sets hotstrings for notes.
- Suspend Hotkeys; disables all hotkeys and hotstrings.
- Change GDS; activate different GDS module and its actions.
- Notes; opens a folder where you'll keep all your notes.
- Help; opens this quick help file.
- Exit; exits application.


NOTES ACTIONS
=============

All notes need to be stored as valid type documents in the "Notes" folder. If you want
to have rich text format notes, you need to have MS Word 2007+ installed, otherwise
use plain notes. To activate Notes action, start by typing `:` followed by `filename`
text (case insensitive) and ending it by hitting key `Enter`.

For instance, if you created filename called "mysig.docx" in "Notes" folder,
to paste its contents somewhere, you will have to type:

> :mysig<ENTER>

You can have subfolders inside the "Notes" folder to better organize your notes.
If across all folders/subfolders you create more files with the same name
(case insensitive), only one will be active (parent folder takes precedence;
with sibling folders alphabetical order takes precedence).

When adding a new note:

1. Open the "Notes" folder (right-click on the Lemonote icon, then click "Notes").
2. Create new document file (.txt, .doc, .docx, ...) file with your content. Save file.
3. Reload Lemonote (double click the Lemonote icon in the tray or right-click on
   Lemonote icon in the tray, then click "Reload Lemonote") to activate hotstring.

Valid file types:
.txt, .doc, .docm, .docx, .dot, .dotm, .dotx, .htm, .html, .mht, .mhtml, .odt,
.rtf, .wps, .xml, .xps


GDS ACTIONS
===========

To activate GDS action, start by typing `::` followed by `command` text and ending it
by hitting key `ENTER`.

For example, if you want to generate APIS "docs" command you will have to type:

> ::docs<ENTER>

FAQ
===

General:

- Can I use Lemonote professionally in my company?
> Yes. You are free to use Lemonote in your company or home as you wish.
  Lemonote is released under MIT license.

- Is Lemonote safe?
> Yes. If AV reports Lemonote as a threat, it is false-positive.

- Does Lemonote require an Internet connection?
> No. Lemonote doesn't require an Internet connection to work. It will not connect
  to any servers even if the internet connection is available.

- Does Lemonote communicate with my GDS?
> No. There isn't any kind of communication between Lemonote and your GDS. After you
  use an action to generate the GDS command, Lemonote will not send it. User is responsible
  for sending a command.

- Does Lemonote record my GDS commands?
> No. Once the GDS command is outputted, it will not be saved or reused again.

- I've seen Lemonote on other web sites, is it ok to download it from there?
> No. You should download Lemonote ONLY from this site. Other sites may provide
  a compromised version.

- Will Lemonote work when I reinstall/change or use an online version of my GDS platform?
> Yes. Lemonote doesn't care about your GDS version if it's desktop or web application.
  As long the GDS/browser window is not minimized or closed,
  it should output the GDS command.

- Does Lemonote prefer one GDS over the other?
> No. Sabre is better supported as it was the main feature starting this project.
  At the moment Amadeus is in beta, but with more user input it will be polished.
  Depending on interest Lemonote may extend its support to Galileo and other systems.

Problems:

- I've added my files in "Notes" folder, but after entering hotstring ":filename<ENTER>"
  command in my editor, Lemonote does nothing. Is this a bug?
> No. After you add new files, you need to reload Lemonote for new hotstrings to be active.
  You can reload Lemonote by double-clicking the icon in the tray or by right-clicking on
  the icon in the tray and choosing "Reload Lemonote". Also, be sure to check if you have
  duplicate files in "Notes" folder, as only one, will be active
  (parent folder takes precedence; with sibling folders,
  alphabetical order takes precedence).

- Lemonote is throwing the "MS Word missing" error. Is this a bug?
> No. If you want to use rich text format notes (.doc/.docx files), you are required
  to have MS Word 2007+ installed. You can use plain format notes (.txt files)
  instead though.

- Lemonote is throwing the "Invalid note file" error. Is this a bug?
> No. Your notes need to be saved in a valid type format.

- Lemonote is throwing "Program window inactive" error. Is this a bug?
> No. Your editor/program, from where you typed action, is either minimized or closed.

- Lemonote is sometimes slow, showing "Initializing..." while getting a note.
  Is this a bug?
> No. Depending on the size of your note, and if a note is in rich or plain text format,
  load time can vary. Lemonote will always try its best to get your notes asap.

- Lemontote installation is throwing warning message "Before reinstalling Lemonote close
  the running instance...". Is this a bug?
> No. Lemonote needs to be closed before fresh install/reinstall due to its cleanup
  routine.
